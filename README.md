# WIN-FOR Salt States
Windows Forensics Environment Salt States

The design behind this is to use a barebones Windows 10 VM or a Windows machine (preferably 1909 and higher to support WSLv2).  
Once configured, and activated (to support customization features), then you can use the winfor-cli.ps1 file to  
install all of the packages.  

If using the PowerShell script, the install requires that the `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` feature be set to allow the script to run at least twice, depending on your choices.  
This is best left to you to decide what is acceptable in your organization.  
  
If using the standalone executable script, you can execute this from and Administrator Command Prompt.

## Issues

All issues should be raised at the [WIN-FOR Repo](https://github.com/digitalsleuth/WIN-FOR)

## What the winfor-cli.ps1 and the winfor-cli.exe installers do:

Installs [Saltstack 3005.1-3](https://repo.saltproject.io/windows/Salt-Minion-3005.1-3-Py3-AMD64-Setup.exe) then installs 
[Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), then runs the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/digitalsleuth/winfor-salt/ "C:\ProgramData\Salt Project\Salt\srv\salt"
salt-call -l debug --local --retcode-passthrough --state-output=mixed state.sls winfor.$mode pillar="{'winfor_user': '$user'}" --log-file="C:\winfor-saltstack.log" --log-file-level=debug --out-file="C:\winfor-saltstack.log" --out-file-append
```
