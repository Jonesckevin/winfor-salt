# WIN-FOR Salt States
Windows Forensics Environment Salt States

The design behind this is to use a barebones Windows 10 VM or a Windows machine (preferably 1909 and higher to support WSLv2).
Once configured, and activated (to support customization features), then you can use one of the installers to
install all of the packages.

The installer is a graphical interface to click and choose which items you want, and to enter the settings you need

Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/digitalsleuth/WIN-FOR/releases) section for the most up-to-date installers.


## PowerShell and CLI DEPRECATED

The PowerShell script and standalone CLI executable have been deprecated in favour of the Win-FOR Customizer.
However, if there is need for a command-line version of the Customizer, it can be done. Until such time, the Customizer is your best choice!
