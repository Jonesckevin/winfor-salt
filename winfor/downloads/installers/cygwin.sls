# Notes: Retcode below is set to '2' for success because the Cygwin installer (even though on Windows) attempts to search for /etc/setup/setup.rc or /etc/setup/installed.db and fails with retcode 2. This causes Saltstack to read an ERROR and result: False, even though the pkg state returns 'install success'.
